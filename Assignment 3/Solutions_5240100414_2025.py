"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
text_string = "Programming"
reversed_text_string = text_string[::-1]
print(reversed_text_string)


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
name = "john doe"
initials = ".".join([word[0].upper() for word in name.strip().split()])
print(initials)


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
text = input("enter a word: ")
cleaned_text = text.replace(" ", "").lower()
if cleaned_text == cleaned_text[::-1]:
    print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The string is not a palindrome.")


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
word_count = len(words)
print(word_count)


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")
print(modified_text)
