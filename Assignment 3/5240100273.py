"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
word_count = len(sentence.split())
print(f"The number of words in the sentence is: {word_count}")


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
