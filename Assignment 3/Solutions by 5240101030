# I Solutions to Assignment 3

# 1. Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
# Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.

text = "Programming"
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print("1. Reversed string:", reversed_text)


# 2. Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
# Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."

full_name = "john doe"  # You can replace this with input() if needed
initials = ".".join([name[0].upper() for name in full_name.split()]) + "."
print("2. Initials:", initials)


# 3. Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
# A palindrome reads the same forwards and backward (e.g., "radar", "level").
# Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.

word = "radar"  # You can replace this with input() if needed
if word == word[::-1]:
    print("3. It's a palindrome!")
else:
    print("3. It's not a palindrome.")


# 4. Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
# Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.

sentence = "This is a sample sentence with seven words"
word_count = len(sentence.split())
print("4. Number of words:", word_count)


# 5. Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string
# "This is a string and it is an example." Print the modified string.

text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")
print("5. Modified string:", modified_text)
