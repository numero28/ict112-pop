"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
text = "Programming"
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print("Reverses: ", reversed-text)

"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a user’s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("Enter Your full name: ")
name_parts = full_name.strip().split()
initials = ".".join([name[0].upper()
for name in name_parts]) + "." 
  print("Initials: ", initials)

"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
word = input("Enter word: ").strip().lower()
if word == word[::-1]:
  print("It is a palindrome. ")
else:
  print("It is not palindrome")
"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence")
words = sentence.strip().split()
  word_count = len(words)
    print("Number of words: ", word_count)
"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
sentence = "this is a string and it is an example."
  modified = sentence.replace("is", "was")
    print("Modified sentence: ", modified)
