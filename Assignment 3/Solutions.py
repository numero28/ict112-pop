"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

original = "Programming"

reversed_string = original[::-1]

print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)

"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""

full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")

initials = [name[0].upper() for name in full_name.split()]

initials_str = ".".join(initials) + "."
print("Initials:", initials_str)

"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
text = input("Enter a string to check if it's a palindrome: ")

processed_text = text.replace(" ", "").lower()

if processed_text == processed_text[::-1]:
    print("Yes, it's a palindrome.")
else:
    print("No, it's not a palindrome.")

"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

words = sentence.split()

word_count = len(words)

print("Number of words in the sentence:", word_count)

"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
text = "This is a string and it is an example."

modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")

print("Modified string:", modified_text)
