"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

original_string = "Programming"


reversed_string = original_string[::-1]

2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""

and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""

4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")


words = sentence.split()


word_count = len(words)
