"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
original_string = "Programming"
reversed_string = original_string[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)




"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name=input("Enter your full name :")
name_parts=full_name. strip(). split ()
initials=[name[0].upper()+'.' for name in Name_part]
print(" ". join (initial))



"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
text = input("Enter a string: ")
text = text.lower()
if text==text[::-1]:
    print(f"'{text}' is not a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"'{text}' is not a palindrome.")


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
ef count_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return len(words)
user_input = input("Enter a sentence: ")
word_count = count_words(user_input)
print(f"The sentence contains {word_count} words.")

5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = text.replace(" is", " was,")
