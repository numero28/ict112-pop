"""

string1 = "Programming"
reversed_string = string1[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""

name = input("Enter Your Full Name: ")
name_parts = full_name.split()
initials = [part[0].upper() for part in name_parts]

3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
text = input("Enter a word: ")
text = text.lower()
if text == text[::-1]:
    print("It is a palindrome!")
else:
    print("It is not a palindrome")



"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
word_count = len(words)
print(f"The number of words in the sentence is:{word_count}")


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""

text = "This is a string and it is an example"
modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")
