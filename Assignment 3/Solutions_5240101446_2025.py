"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

original_string = "Programming"
reversed_string = original_string[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)

"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
name_parts = full_name.strip().split()
initials = ".".join([part[0].upper() for part in name_parts]) + "."
print("Initials:", initials)


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")
normalized_str = user_input.lower()
if normalized_str == normalized_str[::-1]:
    print(f'"{user_input}" is a palindrome.')
else:
    print(f'"{user_input}" is not a palindrome.')


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.strip().split()
word_count = len(words)
print("Number of words:", word_count)


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")
print("Modified string:", modified_text)
