"""
data="Programming"
reverse_data=data[::-1]
print(reverse_data)

2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""

3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
myword=input('Enter a word')
reverse_myword=myword[::-1]

4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
statement=input('Enter a sentence:')

count=len(num_statement):
print(f'There are {count} words in the sentence.')
