Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
main = "programming"
reversed_main = main[::-1]
print(reversed_main)

"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
initials = ".".join(name[0].upper() for name in full_name.split())

3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

string = input("Enter a string: ")
if is_palindrome(string):
    print("It's a palindrome!")
else:
    print("Not a palindrome.")


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
word_count = len(words)
print(f"The sentence contains {word_count} words.")



"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
phrase = "This is a string and it is an example."
