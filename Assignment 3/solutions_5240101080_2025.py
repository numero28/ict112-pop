"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
text="programming"
reversed_text=text[::-1]
print("reversed using slicing:",reversed_text)


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
def get_initials(full_name):
    name_parts= full_name.strip().split()

print("Initials:",get_initials(user_name))



"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
def is_palindrome(s):
    s= s.replace("","").lower()

else:
    print("No, it's not a palindrome.")

4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence=input("Enter sentence")
words=sentence.split()
word_count=len(words)
print("number of words on the sentence:",word_count)



"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
text= "This is a string and it is an example"
modified_text=text.replace("is","was")
