Solutions to assignment 3
"""

"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
original_string = "Programming"
reversed_string = original_string[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)



"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
name_parts = full_name.split()
initials = [part[0].upper() for part in name_parts]
initials_str = '.'.join(initials)
print("Initials:", initials_str)



"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
string = input("Enter a string: ")
if string == string[::-1]:
    print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The string is not a palindrome.")



"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
num_of_words = len(words)
print("The number of words in the sentence is:", num_of_words)



"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
import re
original_string = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_string = re.sub(r'\b(is)\b', 'was', original_string)
print("Modified string:", modified_string)
