"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
text = "Programming"
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print("Reversed string:",reversed_text)

"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full name = input("Enter your name: ")
initials = '.'.join([name[0].upper() for name in full_name.split()])+'.'
print("initials:",initials)

"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
text=input("enter string to check if it's a palindrome:")
if text== text[::-1]:
print("it's a palindrome.")
else:
print("it's not a palindrome.")
"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
Sentence=input("enter a sentence:")
words=sentence.split()
print("Number of words:",len(words))
"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
original_text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = original_text.replace("is","was)
