Solutions to assignment 3



1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.

string_to_reverse = "Programming"
reversed_string = string_to_reverse[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)



2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."

full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
initials = ".".join([word[0].upper() for word in full_name.split()]) + "."
print("Initials:", initials)



3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.

string_to_check = input("Enter a string to check if it is a palindrome: ")
if string_to_check == string_to_check[::-1]:
    print(f"'{string_to_check}' is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"'{string_to_check}' is not a palindrome.")



4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
word_count = len(sentence.split())
print("Number of words in the sentence:", word_count)



5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.


original_text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = original_text.replace("is", "was")
print("Modified string:", modified_text)
