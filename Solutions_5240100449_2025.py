Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

Text="programming"
Text_to_be_reversed=Text[::-1]
print(f"Your reversed text:{Text_to_be_reversed}")


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""

and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""

word="madam"
word_lower_case=word.lower()
if word_lower_case==word_lower_case[::-1]:
    print("The word is a palindrome")
else:
    print("The word is not a palindrome")
    print(word_lower_case[::-1])


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""

sentence=input("Type a sentence:")
sentence1=sentence.split()
print(f"Number of words in your sentence is:{len(sentence1)}")
