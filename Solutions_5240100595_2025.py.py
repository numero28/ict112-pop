"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
 string_to_reverse = "Programming"
 reverse_string = strint_to_reverse [::-1]
 print("reversed_string:", reversed_string)


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("enter your full name:")
name_parts = full_name.split()
initials = [part[0].upper() + '.'for part in name_part]
print("initials:",".join(initials))



"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
user_input = input("Enter a string to check for palindrome:")
      if user_input==user_input[::-1]:
      print("it's palindrome!")
     else:
         print("Not a palindrome.")

"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentenc = input("Enter a sentence:")
word_count = len(sentence.split())
                 print("Number of words:", Word_count)



"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
original_string =" this is a string and it is example."
modified_string = original_string. replace("is", "was")
print("modified string:" Modified_string)
