1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.

3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
