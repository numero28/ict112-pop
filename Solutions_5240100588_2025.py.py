"""
#ANSWER
string = "Programming"
reversed_string = string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)



"""

#ANWER
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ").strip() 
initials = [name[0].upper() for name in full_name.split()]

and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
# ANSWER
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")  
    return s == s[::-1]  


string = input("Enter a string: ")
if is_palindrome(string):
    print(f"'{string}' is a palindrome!")
else:
    print(f"'{string}' is NOT a palindrome.")




"""

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
print("Number of words:", len(words))
