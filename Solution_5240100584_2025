1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

base = "Programming"
reverse_base = base[: : -1]
print(f"Reverse Base of {base} : {reverse_base} ")

"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
name = input("Enter your name : ")
name_parts = name.split()
initials = ' '
for part in name_parts:
	initials += part[0].upper() + " . "
	print(f" {initials [: -1]}" )


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
def is_palindrome(text):
    text = text.lower()
    return text == text[::-1]
string2 = input("Enter a string to check for palindrome: ")
if is_palindrome(string2):
    print(f"'{string2}' is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"'{string2}' is not a palindrome.")


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
word_count = len(sentence.split())
print(f"The sentence has {word_count} words.")

"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""

string1 = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_string = string1.replace("is", "was")
print(f"Modified string: {modified_string}")
