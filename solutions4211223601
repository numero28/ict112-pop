"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

# Original string
text = "Programming"

# Reverse the string using slicing
reversed_text = text[::-1]

# Print the result
print("Reversed string:", reversed_text)

Output:
Reversed string: gnimmargorP
"""

2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
# Get user input
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")

# Split the name and get initials
initials = ".".join([name[0].upper() for name in full_name.split()]) + "."

# Print result
print("Initials:", initials)




"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
# Get input from the user
word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Check if it's a palindrome
if word == word[::-1]:
    print("Yes, it's a palindrome.")
else:
    print("No, it's not a palindrome.")



"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
# Ask for a sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Split the sentence into words
words = sentence.split()

# Count the words
print("Number of words:", len(words))


5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.


text = "This is a string and it is an example."

# Replace "is" with "was"
modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")

# Print the result
print("Modified text:", modified_text)
