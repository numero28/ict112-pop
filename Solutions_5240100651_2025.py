"""

string="programming"

4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""

sentence=input("Enter a sentence")
words= sentence.split()
word_count=len(words)
print("The number of words in the sentence",word_count)
