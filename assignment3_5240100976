"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
string = "Programming"
reversed_string = string[::-1]
print(reversed_string) 



"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
def print_initials(full_name):
    names = full_name.split()
    initials = ".".join(name[0].upper() for name in names)
    print(f"{initials}.")

full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
print_initials(full_name)


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
word = input("Enter a word: ")
reverseword = word[::-1]
if word == reverseword:
    print("it's a palindrome")
else:
    print("it's not a palindrome")



"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
sentenceSplit = sentence.split()
wordSplit =len(sentenceSplit)
print("The number of words in the sentence is ", wordSplit)



"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
sentence = "This is a string and it is an example."
replaceWord = sentence.replace("is","was")
print("Modified String: ", replaceWord)
